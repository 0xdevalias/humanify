# HumanifyJS
> Deobfuscate Javascript code using LLMs ("AI")

This tool uses large language modeles (like ChatGPT & llama) and other tools to
deobfuscate, unminify, transpile, decompile and unpack Javascript code. Note
that LLMs don't perform any structural changes ‚Äì they only provide hints to
rename variables and functions. The heavy lifting is done by Babel on AST level
to ensure code stays 1-1 equivalent.

### Version 2 is out! üéâ

Highlights:
* Python not required anymore!
* A lot of tests, the codebase is actually maintanable now
* Renewed CLI tool `humanify` installable via npm

### ‚û°Ô∏è Check out the [introduction blog post][blogpost] for in-depth explanation!

[blogpost]: https://thejunkland.com/blog/using-llms-to-reverse-javascript-minification

## Example

Given the following minified code:

```javascript
function a(e,t){var n=[];var r=e.length;var i=0;for(;i<r;i+=t){if(i+t<r){n.push(e.substring(i,i+t))}else{n.push(e.substring(i,r))}}return n}
```

The tool will output a human-readable version:

```javascript
function splitString(inputString, chunkSize) {
  var chunks = [];
  var stringLength = inputString.length;
  var startIndex = 0;
  for (; startIndex < stringLength; startIndex += chunkSize) {
    if (startIndex + chunkSize < stringLength) {
      chunks.push(inputString.substring(startIndex, startIndex + chunkSize));
    } else {
      chunks.push(inputString.substring(startIndex, stringLength));
    }
  }
  return chunks;
}
```

üö® **NOTE:** üö®

Large files may take some time to process and use a lot of tokens if you use
ChatGPT. For a rough estimate, the tool takes about 2 tokens per character to
process a file:

```shell
echo "$((2 * $(wc -c < yourscript.min.js)))"
```

So for refrence: a minified `bootstrap.min.js` would take about $0.5 to
un-minify using ChatGPT.

Using `humanify local` is of course free, but may take more time, be less
accurate and not possible with your existing hardware.

## Getting started

### Installation

The fastest way to try out the tool is to run it using `npx`:

```
npx humanifyjs
```

This will download the tool and run it locally. If you want to install the tool
globally, you can do so with:

```shell
npm install -g humanifyjs
```

After the installation is done, you should be able to run the tool globally:

```shell
humanify
```

### Usage

Next you'll need to decide whether to use `openai` or `local` mode. In a
nutshell:

* `openai` mode
  * Runs on someone else's computer that's specifically optimized for this kind
    of things
  * Costs money depending on the length of your code
  * Is more accurate
* `local` mode
  * Runs locally
  * Is free
  * Is less accurate
  * Needs a local GPU with ~8gb RAM (M1 Mac works just fine)
  * Runs as fast as your GPU does

See instructions below for each option:

### OpenAI mode

You'll need a ChatGPT API key. You can get one by signing up at
https://openai.com/.

There are several ways to provide the API key to the tool:
```shell
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-token" > .env && humanify openai obfuscated-file.js
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-token" && humanify openai obfuscated-file.js
OPENAI_TOKEN=your-token humanify openai obfuscated-file.js
humanify --apiKey="your-token" obfuscated-file.js
```

Use your preferred way to provide the API key. Use `humanify --help` to see
all available options.

### Local mode

The local mode uses a pre-trained language model to deobfuscate the code. The
model is not included in the repository due to its size, but you can download it
using the following command:

```shell
humanify download 2gb
```

This downloads the `2gb` model to your local machine. This is only needed to do
once. You can also choose to download other models depending on your local
resources. List the available models using `humanify download`.

After downloading the model, you can run the tool with:

```shell
humanify local obfuscated-file.js
```

This uses your local GPU to deobfuscate the code. If you don't have a GPU, the
tool will automatically fall back to CPU mode. Note that using a GPU speeds up
the process significantly.

Humanify has native support for Apple's M-series chips, and can fully utilize
the GPU capabilities of your Mac.

## Features

The main features of the tool are:
* Uses ChatGPT functions/local models to get smart suggestions to rename
  variable and function names
* Uses custom and off-the-shelf Babel plugins to perform AST-level unmanging
* Uses Webcrack to unbundle Webpack bundles
